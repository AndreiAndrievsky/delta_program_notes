\subsection{Rob Martello and Jean Huang}

Rob suggested a book: branches from the same tree.
He took part in its creation (?).

Rob started with the presentation that we saw during the welcome day at the beginning of our journey.
also as i understood faculty saw this presentation when they were here last time.

It's Mykyta's birthday today.

Rob told about his courses focused on ethics, hystory and things like that.
Jean told about her courses. One of them is biomimicry.

Both Rob's and Jean's courses are not part of any major here in Olin.
That is difficult but students still find them usefull.

\subsection{Excursion at Harvard}

After that we drove to Harvard, where Anna (a harvard student I met at
gala \textit{chez} Alexandra's palce). After that we went to the book store,
and harvard souvenirs store and then went back to the hotel.
