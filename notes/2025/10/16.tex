\subsection{ModSim}

After lunch me and Masha went to modeling and simulation class.
It's taught by Jessy. This class is organized around practical 
experience with modeling using matlab. When I asked why matlab
not python, he told me that it's for historical reasons and
python would work well if we were to make a similar course.
The class encourages students to help one another since they
don't compete for grades. Fiona, a girl I met at Think Like 
a Biologist class is a CA here (her hand is alright now --
it was broken at dancing extracurricular). One student had a
bug in her code. And I joined while Fiona tried to help.
Soon I figured that the problem was the missing multiplication
operator sign between an operand and a brace so it was interpreted
as a function that wasn't defined. That fixed the problem.
