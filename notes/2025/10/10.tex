\subsection{Meeting with John Geddes}

There was a pub quiz. i didn't know answers to any of the 4 questions.
Then he gave us a task of figuring out an old ship blueprint.
And after understanding it more or less (Dmytro did a great job at it)
we were prompted to find a good curve approximation. I used 
least squares which was good enough.
