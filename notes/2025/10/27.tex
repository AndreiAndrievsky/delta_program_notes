After a week of rest we reconvened back in our office.

\subsection{Stickers}

In the morning we got less than a half of our team in the office.
We started with writing what we want to bring to our program
from Olin. After everyone put their top 3 Mariia gave a 5 min
talk about intrinsic motivation. It's based on self-determination theory.
The main three components are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Relatedness
    \item Autonomy
    \item Competencies
\end{enumerate}
This is the base of what Olin does. We virtually reinvented it
with our stickers which is a sanity check in a sense.
