\subsection{A meeting in 428}

in the morning we had a strategic meeting with the team.

\subsection{Software systems}

The only class I attended today was software systems.
Initially I intended to go to QEA1 but Roma convinced me to go to CS.
And I am happy I gave in. TA's name is Steve
% (actually Stefanos -- his father, japanese, studied greek lang for some time. 
% and his mother is korean -- I learned this during lunch).

we stusdied C structs and unit testing. Steve gave me a read access to the git repo for the lab.
after the class he told me about his uni studies and thesis. We talked
about theorem proving languages and how they are important
for compillers' development, Edward Snowden, 
cybersecurity, 2fa, and a lot of other things.
