\subsection{Meeting with Ben}

When we came to Olin we had a meeting at 428 with Ben regarding the program development.

\subsection{QEA 1 and a meeting at 327}

I joined QEA 1. Had to cut it short because Nastasia asked me to join some meeting with herself, 
Roma, Shevchenko, Jessica 
% (met her here, a fairhaired blue-eyed woman with glasses) 
and Lynn. They want to make a workshop on Monday with John Gaddes.
We are planning to squeeze as much as possible in several 
hours out of our meeting with John.
