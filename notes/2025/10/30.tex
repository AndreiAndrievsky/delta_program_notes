\subsection{New Bold Goals}

We took Olin's bold goals from 2000 and worked on what 
to appropriate/adopt and what to change. 
And also on our new goals.

\textbf{\ksed NEW Goals}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item nurture a mindset/culture of life-long learning
    \item brave enough to change the world $\to$ safer technological future
    \item foster curiosity + bravery needed to change the world
    \item personal + professional identity + purpose
\end{enumerate}

We had a discussion whether we should have a civilisational 
goal or a national one. People split whether we should
include Ukrainism into our goals because people can change
the world sitting in Europe and change the world. But on
the other hand after 20-30 years when we (hopefully) have
international students it will be the rub.
