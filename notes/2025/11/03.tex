\subsection{First gathering}

We started at 13:06 -- 6 mins late. At the beginning
Nadya started with explaining our work organization and 
tools.

Next we started discussing how to split the big task into 
tangible small tasks.

\textbf{\nth{1} thing we should deliver is
"learning outcomes".}

- Ability to use maths to describe real-world problems.

- Ability to use maths to solve (?) real-world problems.

- Maths as a \textit{lingua franca}

We decided to split into two groups: \texttt{Ukraine} and \texttt{Olin}.

The mini-output till the end of the week:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Learning outcomes (for the first 2 years of 
    general engineerig)
    \item Important insights
\end{enumerate}

"The essence of maths" -- a variant of a course name.

\textbf{\nth{2} deliverable is -- a list of mathematical concepts(chapters)}

\textbf{2.\nth{5}\ -- Olin review}

\textbf{\nth{3} -- our course system/scheme/matrix}

Based on Olin figure out what courses we are taking from 
them. What gaps are there. How to close them. 
And based on that what people (faculty) we lack.

\textbf{\nth{4} -- requirements to student projects 
measuring what they learned}
