I came late (at 13:20) due to the last night's shelling. 
But they started at 13:15 because I wasn't the only one
to come late. Rebbecca was saying something about a partial 
success in something. Then Nastasia started her presentation.
It's about alignment (with government, with Olin, etc.).

The structure prepared by Slava (?) is: 12 trimesters for 
the course (3 for each year).The main reason is KSE having 
this structure and if we want to align with them we had better
keep it.

They made preliminary courses too:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \nth{1} term -- design nature
    \item \nth{2} term -- design the right thing
    \item \nth{3} term -- how to implement solution
    \item \nth{4} term -- colaborative design
    \item \nth{5} - \nth{9} terms -- design depth
    \item \nth{10} - \nth{12} terms -- capstone project / design justice
\end{itemize}

Then Slava presented his structure of terms in terms (pun uninteded)
of credits and types of classes (general, electives, etc.).
I can't note too much and it doesn't make much sense since that
presentation will be available (I guess). But the work is 
\textit{massive}.
