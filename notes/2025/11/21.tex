\startchapter{Friday closer}{Nov 21, 2025}

today we are closing the first three weeks' sprint after 
coming back from Olin. Olga suggested today we don't focus 
on what went wrong durnig this sprint since we have a whole
review week (the next week). so today we share where we 
currently stand, what we accomplished and what's left to do.

HASS started first because Mariia and Mila are going in 15
mins. 
they 

"we are small HASS team, but we do big things"

the team presented their miro board. it's a lot of text and
tables there, and most importantly it's available to others 
so won't follow in Sisyphus' footsteps.

à ce qu il paraît everyone uses the f-ing miro so today's
notes are scarce.
