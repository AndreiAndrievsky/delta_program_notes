\subsection{Intro}

We'll meet new people today.
We've got approval to be an active part of the Design nature course.\\
The launch 4:15 tomorrow (04.09.2025) we'll get a link.
There's a group at MIT, affiliated to the national defense. And we are invited, there's a lot of content. We are encouraged to make a team (and to build connections while there).\\
We'll be probably offered a tuition after the work is done in case we want to continue our edu here.

\subsection{What is GAPA?}

GAPA stands for Goal, Activity, Product, Assesment.

Here is my visualisation maybe I'll need it in the future.

% % Method 1: Automatic layout (easier)
% \subsection{Project Planning with GAPA}

% \gapaframework{
%     Learn Circuit Analysis, Master Ohm's Law, Understand Kirchhoff's Laws, Solve Complex Circuits
% }{
%     Read Textbook Ch.1-3, Practice Problems, Lab Experiments, Group Study, Watch Video Lectures
% }{
%     Lab Reports, Problem Solutions, Circuit Designs, Presentation, Final Project
% }{
%     Midterm Exam, Lab Quizzes, Homework Grades, Project Evaluation, Final Exam
% }


% Method 2: Manual placement (more control)
