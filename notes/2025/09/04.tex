\section{\texorpdfstring{\chaptertitle}{Design nature, Sep 4th}}

It was an itrodutory lecture. 
We watched a video about why owls fly silently.
The presentation had a plethora of examples of 
appropriating natural designs into what we,
hummans, do. Not much to write down, even though
quite a lot was said. We were present only on
the first half since after it they went to "studios"
(whatever this means).
