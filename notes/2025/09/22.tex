\subsection{Manifesto}

Kate led this part. She shared some files with us.
We chose motivations and values. And then we chose values for the program.
She mentioned that we will receive a feedback form her (non-anonymous so she can track who filled it in).
Learned that Andrii wants to become an oligarch in a good sense.
We mostly discussed our values so not much to write down.
Masha Alipatova is very much like me, she is also into order and organisation.
